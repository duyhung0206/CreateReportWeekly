        "description":"Hello Anthony,\n\nI am Sally back with you here. How are you doing?  :)\n\nI have been informed by my customer support agent - Jan about your demand on having a new customization with Magestore as below:\n\n_\"I am writing to open a dialogue in relation to customisation works for our extensions from Magestore for Magento ver. 2.1.9 community edition. As I have held previous discussions into this matter with yourselves, find the tasks outlined below for ease of reference._\n_1. Magestore Purchase Management = Fix Error\nA. Go to ‘Purchase Management > Manage Suppliers’\ni. It doesn’t work, reference screenshot titled ‘2018-01-13 (1)’.\nii. May you advise?\n2. Magestore Inventory Management = Customisation\nA. Definitions of Terminology\n• MIN = Low Stock Level, Each Product Must be Modifiable\ni. When a particular product hits the low level, then we receive a notification. Each product will have a different ‘MIN’ level.\nii. When a purchase order is created, we want to be able to view this attribute as a priority. I believe this is the case already with the extension because I tested your demo however I cannot create a supplier to test it now…\n• MAX = Ideal Stock Level, Each Product Must be Modifiable\ni. When we are in ‘Inventory Management > Stocks in Warehouse’ we desire to be able to modify a ‘MAX’ level. Each product will have a different ‘MAX’ level.\nii. When a purchase order is created, we want to be able to click a hyperlink next to the ‘MAX’ attribute, to make it easier for us since there are thousands of products.\nB. MIN & MAX Attributes\nMust be shown and editable in the following locations\n• Purchase Management > Purchase Orders\nNote: I cannot define the exact locations because I am unable to create a new supplier…\n• Inventory Management > Stocks in Warehouse\nC. Quantity Attributes Must Be Shown in\n• In ‘All Supplier Products’\n• Shown in ‘Purchase Order List’\n• Note: I cannot define the exact locations because I am unable to create a new supplier…\nD. The ‘Quantity’ that is being ordered, must be modifiable\n• I believe this is the case already with the extension because I tested your demo however I cannot create a supplier to test it now…\n3. Magento Order Management Fulfilment = In Need\nA. I was under the impression that this would be included with the extensions that have been already purchased. Do we have to buy this module?\nB. When preparing orders, we need pictures to be displayed so our staff identifies the items easier.\nC. I need to be able to use the extension to tell you where the pictures need to be located, may you advise?\n4. Inventory Management > Stocks in Warehouse = Customisation\nA. We need to see the supplier associated to the product in this section.\nB. We need to see the supplier associated to the product when preparing an order via ‘Purchase Management’.\nC. I believe this is the case already with the extension because I tested your demo however I cannot create a supplier to test it now…\n5. System > All Users > Users = Fix Error\nA. After the installation of our extensions, we discovered that we are unable to delete users which is a Magento default feature.\nB. It is in the opinion of one third party developer that this is due to your extension, find their notes highlighted below in bold.\nC. “Developer completed his investigation and provided feedback that the issue with possibility to delete users occurs because of the Magestore extension._\n_Developer checked delete method \\Magento\\Backend\\Block\\Widget\\Button\\ButtonList::remove and set stack trace output._\n_As it can be observed via stack trace, first call is executed correctly, while second call is being executed after \"Delete\" button was displayed and being called by observer located under the following path: /var/www/html/app/code/Magestore/InventorySuccess/Observer/Sales/Order/View/BeforeToHtml.php which leads to the Magestore Inventory extension._\n_This way, disabling of this extension should resolve the issue with users deletion.”\nD. Find attached the stack trace log for your reference.\nE. May you advise?\n6. Migration of Inventory Data from ERP off live website to development website to Magestore’s Inventory Management Extension = Customisation\nA. This must be arranged to be done as a last step.\nB. The data must include all of our suppliers, current stock, our cost and et cetera\n7. May you double check that the extensions are ready for launch (for use on a live website / production environment)? = Service_\n_Kindly note, that we want to stage the migration of data as a last step. In other words, we do not desire to implement the works for the migration now, but at a time of our choosing.\"_\n\nI would like to confirm that I have already received your requirement and am discussing with my customization team for the best solution.\n\nI hope you can give me a little more time to check. I will try to get a feedback for you here soon :)\n\n\n\nBest regards,\nSally",

        "description":"Hi Guys\n\nWe have been having issues with customers saying that when placing orders they were advised that there was stock when in fact there was no stock.\n\nWe have eventually identified the problem and discovered that it is a bug in the customisation work you carried out which I believe was done by Hades.\n\nYou customised the \"Availability\" on the front end as shown on the attached screenshot. If there is no available stock at either the local or supplier's warehouse then it displays \"On Order with Supplier\".\n\nThe problem occurs when for example there is qty 2 in stock and a customer places an order for 2. When you check the Magento Quantity attribute there is 0 stock which is perfectly correct and there is no free stock to allocate to further orders meaning that any future orders should be placed on backorder.\n\nHowever the customised software still shows the product as \"In Stock\" until such time as the order is processed and then it correctly displays  \"On Order with Supplier\". \n\nThis suggests that the customisation is not using either the Magento Qty attribute or the \"Available Qty\" in determining the correct Availability message to display on the front end.\n\nCan you please investigate and advise.\n\nBest Regards\n\nPeter",
